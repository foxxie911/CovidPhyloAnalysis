### Project Overview

This project analyzes the complete and randomized sequences of SARS-CoV-2 virus also known as COVID-19 downloaded from [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/).
As part of analysis a database has been created from the metadata of those sequences.
Using `Clustal Omega` the sequences are aligned and a Phylogenetic Tree is constructed for mutation analysis.
Also, Distance Matrix is created to quantify the mutation distance.
Analysing the Phylogenetic Tree, root, leaf and clade regions are identified and the furthest clade is shown.

### Libraries Used
